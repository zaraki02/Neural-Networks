# Neural-Networks
Neural network created without using machine learning libaries like tensorflow or keras
This is a self implemented neural networks purely based on the mathematics behind the neural networks without the use of ML libraries like Tensorflow or Keras, with the weights and inputs taken both in vectorized
(much faster than neural network with only vectorized weights)
